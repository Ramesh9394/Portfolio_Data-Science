[1. Telecom Churn]()
The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months.
The challange was that data is not labelled, so we had to label the data considering the behaviours of the customers for the last three month and tag them either `Churn` or `Non-Churn`.
