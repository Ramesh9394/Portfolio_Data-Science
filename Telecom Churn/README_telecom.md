# Telecom Churn Prediction

### Business problem overview 
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose 
from multiple service providers and actively switch from 
one operator to another. In this highly competitive 
market, the telecommunications industry experiences an 
average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that 
it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than 
to retain an existing one, **customer retention** has now 
become even more important than customer acquisition.   

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable 
customers is the number one business goal.

### Objective
- To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

### Challenges
- The data given was not labelled, so biggest Challenges were to tag customers either `Churn` or `Non-Churn` based on the activities from previous data.
- Next challange was to correctly identify all the potential chuner in churn phase.
